# Next Word Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate models for predicting the next word in a sequence of text, using Jupyter Notebooks for code exploration and analysis.

## Overview

The repository explores natural language processing (NLP) techniques for next word prediction, including data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. It is designed for students, researchers, and developers interested in language modeling and predictive text systems.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Implementation of next word prediction models
- Training and evaluating model performance
- Visualization of results and predictions

## Tools Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and documentation
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NLTK**, **spaCy**, or **TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch**: NLP and deep learning libraries for model implementation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/utkarsh884/Next-Word-Prediction.git
cd Next-Word-Prediction
```

Install dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` file is provided):
```bash
